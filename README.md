# Yet Another Random Code
Repository of unrelated useful bioinformatics scripts

* `reads_generator.py` 

is an ad-hoc NGS reads simulator, based on Metropolis-Hastings sampling for read lengths, without sequencing errors (sort of like wgsim)

* `metaG_mix.py` 

simulates metagenomics NGS reads with a lognorm abundance distribution over the genomes (sort of like CAMISIM)
